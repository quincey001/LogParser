*) Support saving TDF file
Changed Files: SystemConfig.cpp/h
Added files: TDF.cpp/h
Description:
- Add NIST_SUPPORT in cls_cls.cfg
- Add cls_nist.cfg. A sample and explaination is put in misc
- Add a new class CTDF, which calls some functions of lscvt.lib
and tdf.lib.
Comments:
- CTDF need to be enhanced. The basic idea is to use a base class for
initing, reading existing TDF file and saving repacked TDF file. No
binding data (a virtual function) in base class. Three new class will
be derived from the base class to bind three kinds of data: from
WinCtrlSet, cls_nist.cfg, images. Then ClsMain and ClsDataEntry can
call different class as they required.

*) Florida payment interface
Changed files: SystemConfig.cpp/h
Description:
- It map FirstName, LastName, MidName, SufName before. Now it only map
the Name field.
*) Flat App Version
Changed files: SystemConfig.cpp/h
Description:
- Read nFlatAppVersion in Cls_cls.cfg

*) Add code to delete transactions from nist_ipa, nist_ipa_pm, nist_ipa_print,
nist_ipa_print_pm
Changed files:
- SystemTrans.cpp
- SystemTransNew.cpp
- SystemTrans.h
Description:
- Add one new function: CLSTransDeleteException
- Call this new function in CLSTransDeleteRec() and CLSTransNewDeleteRec()
- In this case, these four tables should not be put in INFO_TABLE. Before
we put them into it, which will cause a bug: When the transaction has
exception and has been scanned, the exception will be removed if user
views demo and saves it.

*) Add a config item PALM_CHECK_VERSION in cls_scan.cfg
Changed files: SystemConfig.cpp/h

Changed files: SystemConfig.cpp/h
Description:
Add them for new algorithm of palm sequence check
Default values are 0

gdslib/gd_pub.h.
Changed files: SystemIo.cpp/h
12/17/2004, Eric
*) Added a new config item to cls_scan.cfg, FLAT_PALM_OPTIONAL
Changed files: SystemConfig.cpp/h
*) Added a new config item to cls_scan.cfg, EXCEPTION_ALWAYS
Always save excpetion data (For Mexico)

Changed files: SystemConfig.cpp/h
*) Added a new function call CLSDbDeleteRecord()
Changed files: SystemDb.cpp/h
01/06/2005, Simon
*) Changed data structure CLS_CFG_CALLTAB and functions CLSCfgLoadCalltab()
and CLSIoCallApp() to support application module in DLL mode;
